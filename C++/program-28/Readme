Given a number n, print all primes smaller than or equal to n. It is also given that n is a small number. 
The Sieve of Eratosthenes is one of the most efficient ways to find all primes smaller than n when n is smaller than 10 million or so.
Following is the algorithm to find all the prime numbers less than or equal to a given integer n by the Eratostheneâ€™s method: 

When the algorithm terminates, all the numbers in the list that are not marked are prime. 
 
Explanation with Example: 
1. Let us take an example when n = 50. So we need to print all prime numbers smaller than or equal to 50. 
2. We create a list of all numbers from 2 to 50. 
3. According to the algorithm we will mark all the numbers which are divisible by 2 and are greater than or equal to the square of it. 
4. Now we move to our next unmarked number 3 and mark all the numbers which are multiples of 3 and are greater than or equal to the square of it. 
5. We move to our next unmarked number 5 and mark all multiples of 5 and are greater than or equal to the square of it. 
6. We move to our next unmarked number 5 and mark all multiples of 5 and are greater than or equal to the square of it. 



Example:    Input : n =10
            Output : 2 3 5 7 

            Input : n = 20 
            Output: 2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19


MAIN OUTPUT:-

Following are the prime numbers smaller  than or equal to 30
2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19 23 29 


Time complexity : O(n*log(log(n)))
